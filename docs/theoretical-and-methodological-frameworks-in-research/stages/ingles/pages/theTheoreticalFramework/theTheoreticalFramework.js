                        <h4>Conception of the Theoretical Framework</h4>
                        <p>The theoretical framework describes and intertwines the different theories and principles that are related to the main topics of the research study. These theories legitimize the investigative process by situating the research problem in a real context, by relating the established knowledge that surrounds that problem, and by searching a way to either explain phenomena, solve conflicts, fill gaps, improve processes, or whatever the problem is.</p>
                        <p>It is in this spirit that the theoretical framework has a close connection to the literature review since the review highlights the problem that needs “fixing”, whereas the theoretical framework explains the theories, propositions, hypotheses, and concepts that the researcher will use to address or make sense of this problem. This, according to Lempriere, 2019.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, this framework supports the data analysis stage, allowing the researcher to convincingly interpret the results and explain their broader relevance to the field.</p>

                        <h4>Building up the Theoretical Framework</h4>
                        <p>When building up the theoretical framework, several steps should be considered. There are no fixed rules for its structure but it must be clear, intertwined and logical. One option is to organize several sections around key concepts, models or questions.</p>
                    <p>List the constructs and the variables that might be relevant to the study by examining the research problem, topic and field. The length and complexity of the framework will depend on them.</p>
                    <p>List several theories that align with the epistemological position or outlook of the study. The theories must be epistemologically compatible with each other even if they correspond to different disciplines.</p>
                    <p>All the selected theories and definitions must connect to the problem, aims and objectives. If there is a well-established theory or model that is not going to be applied to the research, explain why it is not suitable for the purposes or methodologies of the study.</p>
                    <p>Identify in the reviewed literature how authors have addressed the problem and associate the selected theories to those assumptions.</p>
                    <p>There may be many potential theories about the topic, so the theoretical framework means comparing, evaluating, and selecting the most relevant ones that provide more relevant tools for the thesis.</p>
                    <p>The concepts, definitions and technical language used must be justified, properly defined and congruently associated with the topic, problem and objectives of the research.</p>
                    <p>When selecting a theory, you should consider its appropriateness, ease of application, and explanatory power of the problem. It is not about selecting a theory just because it is related to the topic, yet because it explains the problem appropriately and provides some outlooks to the solution.</p>
                    <p>Evaluate whether you will discuss each theory in the same level of detail to adequately explain them, or there will be a more prevalent theory than another.</p>
                    <p>Discuss concepts and theories along with the research problem by making connections and establishing relationships so the problem finds responses in the theories and they lead the research work to be done.</p>

                    <h3>Facts about the Theoretical Framework</h3>
                    <p>The theories must be connected to the whole research: problem, methodologies, analysis, findings, discussions and future research, and these theories should be taken from different disciplines in order to understand the research problem broadly and to position it within a wider context of related frameworks, concepts, models, or theories. This will avoid choosing theory randomly and will help understand the pertinence and application of the theories in the study.</p>

                        <h4>Facts about the Theoretical Framework</h4>
                        <p>The theoretical framework is not an exclusive and isolated chapter of the thesis, but these theories should guide the study throughout the paper. The researcher must connect theory to the methodological procedures as well as to the data analysis, findings, discussions and future research. </p>
                        <p>To understand the research problem broadly by using theories, an interdisciplinary perspective is suggested, this means not relying exclusively on the theories within a particular discipline, but to consider theories developed in other disciplines to inform issues.</p>
                        <p>The theoretical framework needs to be positioned within a broader context of related frameworks, concepts, models, or theories in order to justify why the chosen theories are the appropriate ones for the study.</p>
                        <p>A theory always requires a framework for understanding its application to the topic being investigated. Researchers should clearly describe the framework, concepts, models, or specific theories that underpin the study. This includes noting who the key theorists are in the field, who has conducted research on the same problem and, when necessary, the historical context that supports the formulation of those theories. This latter element is particularly important if the theory is relatively unknown or it is borrowed from another discipline.</p>
                        <p>Researchers should not take everything what theories say as absolute truth since reality is not accurately represented in such a simplistic way. Limitations of the chosen theoretical framework should be critically noted (i.e., parts of the research problem that require further investigation because the theory inadequately explains a certain phenomenon).</p>
                        <p>The present tense is used when writing down this framework since the development of knowledge is happening now, although the past tense can be used to describe the history of a theory or the role of key theorists.</p>
