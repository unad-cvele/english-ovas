      <div class="text-general">
            <p>Hurtado de Barrera (2000) conceives research as an inquiry process which seeks to learn about some event, either with the aim of finding general laws or simply of obtaining particular answers to a determined need or concern. This concern or need is known as a <strong>problem</strong>.</p>
            <p>The research problem is then the issue that will be addressed by means of research procedures. Its ultimate goal is to transform a generalized problem into a targeted, well-defined problem; one that can be resolved through focused research and careful decision-making.</p>
